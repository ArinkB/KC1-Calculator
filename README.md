# KC1-Calculator
Software Developement KC1 Project

Hello and welcome to my first Knowledge Check project for the Code Louisville 
Software Development Path.

I was able to accomplish the ask to create the multiplication functionality, but had trouble with the Optional part.

As you will find looking at my EntryVerification.cs that I tried but there were some issues. I do believe that there is alot more that I need to understand before I can get this project to do what I envisioned. 
I fully intend to return to the project and correct my mistakes once I have learned more. 
Feel free to remove the block comment in the EntryVerification.cs class to see what I was going for. 

Thank you,
Arink
